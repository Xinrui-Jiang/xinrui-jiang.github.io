<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a fourth-year Biomedical Engineering undergraduate at Fudan University. During my undergraduate study, I was fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href='https://taco-group.github.io/index.html'>Zhengzhong Tu</a> at Texas A&M University and Professor <a href='https://nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~berkin/index.html'>Berkin Bilgic</a> at Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging/Harvard Medical School. Prior to that, I was also an undergraduate research student at Professor <a href='https://www.fudanroilab.com/'>Wenqiang Zhang</a>'s team.

My research interest lies in modeling real-world biomedical phenomena and solving corresponding challenges with computational methods, especially machine learning. Specifically, I distill specific problems into rigorous formulations, embedded with domain knowledge, and design tailored algorithms. To achieve this, my research orientation includes two intertwined branches: understanding frontier challenges in domains such as Imaging Neuroscience and Inverse Problems; studying state-of-the-art methodology in self-supervised learning, generative AI, and numerical optimization.

- We purposed NLCG-Net, a model-based and data-driven framework achieved via self-supervised learning, which incorporates nonlinear conjugate gradient optimization and Neural Network Regularization in a iterative manner and achieves zero-shot quantitative MRI reconstruction. T1, T2 mapping results on phantom and in-vivo data demonstrates NLCG-Net's superiority on estimation quality at high acceleration.
